I am an Economics PhD Student at Brown University interested in Development Economics and Political Economy. In particular, my research focuses on Crime and Criminal Organizations, which pose significant challenges to development in my country.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also interested in addressing these issues on a practical level. I co-founded an NGO dedicated to scientific dissemination in my hometown, Rio de Janeiro, and I have also gained valuable experience working in the private and public sector.

# Some of my Favourite Albums (Randomly Ordered)

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
# Set the folder path (change "images" to your folder name if different)
folder_path <- "Albuns"

# List all PNG, JPG, or JPEG files (case-insensitive)
imgs <- list.files(path = folder_path, 
                   pattern = "\\.(png|jpg|jpeg)$", 
                   full.names = TRUE, 
                   ignore.case = TRUE)

# Number of images per row
n_per_row <- 4

if (length(imgs) > 0) {
  # Split the vector of images into groups of 4
  img_groups <- split(imgs, ceiling(seq_along(imgs) / n_per_row))
  
  # Start an HTML table
  cat("<table style='width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;'>\n")
  
  for (group in img_groups) {
    cat("  <tr>\n")
    for (img in group) {
      # Adjust the width (or other styling) as needed
      cat("    <td style='text-align: center; padding: 5px;'>\n")
      # Set the image width to 200px (adjust as desired)
      cat(sprintf("      <img src='%s' style='width:200px; height:auto;' />\n", img))
      cat("    </td>\n")
    }
    cat("  </tr>\n")
  }
  
  cat("</table>\n")
} else {
  cat("No images found in the folder.")
}
