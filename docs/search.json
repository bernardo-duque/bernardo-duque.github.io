    "section": "",
    "text": "We investigate selection into criminality. Specifically, we use a noveldataset on inmates across 24 of 26 Brazilian states and rich administrative data to draw the profiles of criminals born between 1996 and 2002. We compare them with non-criminal individuals from the same cohort using a linearprobability model with year of birth and place fixed effects. Our findings suggest that criminals come from more urban and vulnerable places, with a higher exposure to other criminals. In addition, our results indicate that family structure matters and that parents of criminals are more economically vulnerable than parents of non-criminals. Finally, criminals have worse educational performance, a history of juvenile detention, and worse labor market performance.\nLink to paper"
