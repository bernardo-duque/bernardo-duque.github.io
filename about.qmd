## Education

I hold a Bachelor's degree  a Master's degree in Economics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Economics at Brown University.

## Experience

I have worked as an research assistant in several projects since 2020. Some of the topics of these projects are the effects of pretrial detention arrest on recidivism; the expasion of drug-trafficking organizations in Rio; testing predictions of the median voter theorem; and investigating whether politicians keep their campaign promises after being elected. 

I have also worked in the public sector as data analyst for the Research Center at the Public's Attorney's Office of Rio de Janeiro. I assisted research on militias and drug-trafficking organizations in Rio.

Further, I have experience in the private sector for consulting firms in Brazil, where I worked on projects related to economic analysis and policy evaluation.
