## Education

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Economics at Brown University. I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Economics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). 

## Experience

I have worked as an research assistant in several projects since 2020. Some of the topics of these projects are the effects of pretrial detention arrest on recidivism; the expasion of drug-trafficking organizations in Rio; the investigation of some predictions of the median voter theorem; and the study of whether politicians keep their campaign promises after being elected. 

I have also worked in the public sector as a data analyst for the Research Center at the Public's Attorney's Office of Rio de Janeiro. I assisted research on militias and drug-trafficking organizations in Rio.

Further, I have experience in the private sector for consulting firms in Brazil, where I worked on projects related to economic analysis and policy evaluation.

## Some of my Favourite Albums (Randomly Ordered)

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
# Set the folder path (change "images" to your folder name if different)
folder_path <- "Albuns"

# List all PNG, JPG, or JPEG files (case-insensitive)
imgs <- list.files(path = folder_path, 
                   pattern = "\\.(png|jpg|jpeg)$", 
                   full.names = TRUE, 
                   ignore.case = TRUE)

# Number of images per row
n_per_row <- 4

if (length(imgs) > 0) {
  # Split the vector of images into groups of 4
  img_groups <- split(imgs, ceiling(seq_along(imgs) / n_per_row))
  
  # Start an HTML table
  cat("<table style='width:100%; border-collapse: collapse;'>\n")
  
  for (group in img_groups) {
    cat("  <tr>\n")
    for (img in group) {
      # Adjust the width (or other styling) as needed
      cat("    <td style='text-align: center; padding: 5px;'>\n")
      # Set the image width to 200px (adjust as desired)
      cat(sprintf("      <img src='%s' style='width:200px; height:auto;' />\n", img))
      cat("    </td>\n")
    }
    cat("  </tr>\n")
  }
  
  cat("</table>\n")
} else {
  cat("No images found in the folder.")
}
